This repository stores all the files of the MSC thesis. Here we present code to obtain topics from the projects funded under the European Union Framework Programmes, and for project funded by the NSF in the United States. We use Latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling in projects' abstracts that funded from 1994 to 2017.

## Getting Started

The 'src' file consists of all the code for generating LDA topics.
